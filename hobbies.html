    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy engaging in activities that help me stay productive, creative, and mentally active. I like learning new digital tools and exploring technology trends that improve my professional skills. Reading informative articles and industry blogs helps me stay updated and think analytically. I also enjoy blogging and content writing, as it allows me to express ideas clearly while improving communication skills. Alongside this, I follow cricket and enjoy team-based activities, which strengthen discipline and teamwork. These hobbies contribute to my personal development and motivate me to stay focused, positive, and continuously improve myself.
